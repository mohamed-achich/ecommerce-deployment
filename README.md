# E-Commerce Platform Infrastructure & Deployment

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates my expertise in modern DevOps practices and cloud-native architecture through a production-grade e-commerce platform deployment. The infrastructure is designed to be scalable, resilient, and follows industry best practices for security and monitoring.

## Technical Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS EKS
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **Package Management**: Kustomize
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets

### CI/CD
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment Strategy**: GitOps with automated rollbacks
- **Environment Management**: Staging and Production environments

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus
- **Logging**: ELK Stack
- **Alerting**: AlertManager

## Architecture Highlights

- **Microservices Architecture**: Decomposed into independent, scalable services
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized routing and authentication
- **Event-Driven Design**: Asynchronous communication using message queues
- **Database Per Service**: Independent data stores for service autonomy
- **Auto-Scaling**: HPA for dynamic workload management
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with pod anti-affinity

## DevOps Best Practices

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - Terraform modules for AWS infrastructure
  - Kustomize overlays for environment-specific configurations
  - Version-controlled infrastructure changes

- **Continuous Deployment**
  - Automated deployment pipelines
  - Environment promotion workflow
  - Canary deployments for risk mitigation

- **Security**
  - Network policies for service isolation
  - RBAC implementation
  - Secrets encryption at rest
  - Regular security scanning

- **Monitoring**
  - Real-time metrics and alerting
  - Distributed tracing
  - Centralized logging
  - Performance monitoring

```

## Infrastructure Design

The infrastructure follows a multi-environment setup with complete isolation between staging and production:

- **Networking**: VPC with public and private subnets
- **Security**: Network ACLs, Security Groups, and Pod Security Policies
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling groups and Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- **Reliability**: Multi-AZ deployment with automated failover

## Deployment Strategy

The deployment process implements a robust GitOps workflow:

1. **Feature Branch** → Automated testing and validation
2. **Staging Branch** → Deployment to staging environment
3. **Main Branch** → Production deployment with canary release

Each step includes automated validation, security checks, and rollback capabilities.
